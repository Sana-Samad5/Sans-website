<!-- Paragraphs by default come with margin!! but we can change it according to our needs.-->

<!-- for a dot to come in between, we go to google and look for html entity middle dot and copy and paste the code for it here i.e that 183 thingy-->

<!-- width is used to wrap around the text-->
 <!-- Line height is used to keep spaces between the lines-->

 <!-- CSS has specificity, i.e individual classes have more priority than the combined paragraph style for all classes. -->

<!-- these strong and u are text elements that work on part of texts in a sentence.-->
 <!-- the span element doesnt make any changes to the text, but span can be given a class and then we can style that particular text in span accordingly. note: we can give a class to other elements like strong and u also but then they come with a default style already , so we dont ususally prefer that.-->
  <!-- to achive multiple spaces between texts in a sentence, we can use the margin element.-->
