 <!-- button here is a CSS Selector=which elements we are targetting.-->
<!-- the background color is the CSS Property and the color red is the CSS value. Also in CSS we end the style by a semicolon; We can add multiple styles inside the curly brackets.-->
<!-- For changing text color, we dont write text color, we write only color:-->
<!-- rgb reperesents red,blue,green , we can change those values to get what we want., The max values of rgb are 255,255,255 which gives white and minimum value of rgb are 0,0,0 which gives black.-->
<!--The more the border-radius, the more the button will be curved.-->
<!-- shadow will have 4 things,first one moves shadow to right, second one moves shadow to right-downside, third one is blur of shadow, fourth one is the shadow color -->
<!--to set a shadow inside/inwards we should put "inset" , like box-shadow:inset 1px 2px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05) -->

<!-- here class is labeling(labe name here is subscribe-button) of a button to seperate it from other button. look above in style, we wrote .subcribe-button to put styles for it. -->
 <!-- Also, multiple classes can have same labels.-->
  <!--hover is a pseudo class, it basically adds extra styles in a certain situation-->
  <!-- has values from 0 to 1, it is used to fade out an element making it lighter when we hover over it. -->
<!--active pseudo class,activates a button when clicked, example when we click a button color changes to blue.-->
<!-- margin means space after button towards right.-->
 <!-- transition takes two values, what we want to transition and time in seconds-->
<!--CSS Box Model is how much space an element takes up and how far it is away from other elements.-->
<!-- padding is how much space to leave inside the box, it can be done from four sides, padding-left, padding right, padding top, padding bottom. -->
 <!-- Instead of using height and width, padding is used beacause its better.-->
  <!-- vertical-align will align all elements in page at same level-->
 <!-- link element doesnt require a closing tag, these elements that dont require a closing tag are called void elements.-->
